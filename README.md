alea iacta est

Hello earthlings,

I'm new to coding. I'm a scout and a part of the information gathering division of the first invansion/subjugation squad sent to your planet.
Prepare to be subjugated in no more than a million years.
For any complaints or objections, please promptly report to your nearest galaxy, Andromeda's civil workers office.
